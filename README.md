# Ahoy Email

:construction: Coming soon - May 1, 2014

:envelope: Simple, powerful email tracking for Rails

Keep track of emails:

- sent
- opened
- clicked

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ahoy_email'
```

And run the generator. This creates a model to store messages.

```sh
rails generate ahoy_email:install
rake db:migrate
```

## How It Works

Ahoy creates an `Ahoy::Message` record when an email is sent. It also adds:

- open tracking
- click tracking
- UTM parameters

## TODO

- Subscription management (lists, opt-outs)
