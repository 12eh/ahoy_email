# Ahoy Email

:construction: Coming soon - May 1, 2014

:envelope: Simple, powerful email tracking for Rails

Keep track of emails:

- sent
- opened
- clicked

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ahoy_email'
```

And run the generator. This creates a model to store messages.

```sh
rails generate ahoy_email:install
rake db:migrate
```

## How It Works

Ahoy creates an `Ahoy::Message` record when an email is sent. It also adds:

- open tracking
- click tracking
- UTM parameters

To specify the user, use:

```ruby
mail user: user, subject: "Awesome!", to: "..."
```

User is [polymorphic](http://railscasts.com/episodes/154-polymorphic-association), so use it with any model.
